This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Project Description

It's the year 2137 and luckily planet Earth still exists. In a futuristic city called Auxburg the
most important intergalactic digital service company on the planet is found: omsert
GmbH.

They just received a very exciting message: some English speaking extraterrestrial tourists
from planet Kepler-186f want to visit our planet next month. Of course they are unsure
what places to see or how to find them. To help our friendly neighbours omsert is creating
an efficient and simple web app with information about the countries of the Earth.

Unfortunately the omsert team is very busy due to several requests from planet KrypIoT
and MarsLearning and therefore needs your help: Develop a fantastic and informative
web app and help us make our friends happy!

Functional requirements
As an extraterrestrial tourist I want to:
* Get an overview over all countries of the world
  * Name, flag and population are displayed
* Get more detailed information about a specific country
  * Continent, capital, currency and timezone are displayed
* See a selected country marked on a global map
  * Use GoogleMaps, OpenStreetMap or something similar
  * The zoom level should be adjusted according to the size of the country
* Sort countries by name or population
* Search for a specific country
* Share country information via link

Non-functional requirements
* Design is according to the corporate identity (see below)
* Design for mobile devices only (full responsiveness optional)
* App in English language
* Use the existing country API: https://restcountries.eu
* Use Angular or React to implement the web application
* Version your code with git and make it available on GitHub or GitLab
* The web app runs on a current Chrome, Firefox or Safari browser
