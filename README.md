This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It's the year 2137 and luckily planet Earth still exists. In a futuristic city called Auxburg the
most important intergalactic digital service company on the planet is found: omsert
GmbH.

They just received a very exciting message: some English speaking extraterrestrial tourists
from planet Kepler-186f want to visit our planet next month. Of course they are unsure
what places to see or how to find them. To help our friendly neighbours omsert is creating
an efficient and simple web app with information about the countries of the Earth.

Unfortunately the omsert team is very busy due to several requests from planet KrypIoT
and MarsLearning and therefore needs your help: Develop a fantastic and informative
web app and help us make our friends happy!

## Updating to New Releases

Create React App is divided into two packages:

* `create-react-app` is a global command-line utility that you use to create new projects.
* `react-scripts` is a development dependency in the generated projects (including this one).

You almost never need to update `create-react-app` itself: it delegates all the setup to `react-scripts`.

When you run `create-react-app`, it always creates the project with the latest version of `react-scripts` so you’ll get all the new features and improvements in newly created apps automatically.

To update an existing project to a new version of `react-scripts`, [open the changelog](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), find the version you’re currently on (check `package.json` in this folder if you’re not sure), and apply the migration instructions for the newer versions.

In most cases bumping the `react-scripts` version in `package.json` and running `npm install` in this folder should be enough, but it’s good to consult the [changelog](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for potential breaking changes.

We commit to keeping the breaking changes minimal so you can upgrade `react-scripts` painlessly.
