This project was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It's the year 2137 and luckily planet Earth still exists. In a futuristic city called Auxburg the
most important intergalactic digital service company on the planet is found: omsert
GmbH.

They just received a very exciting message: some English speaking extraterrestrial tourists
from planet Kepler-186f want to visit our planet next month. Of course they are unsure
what places to see or how to find them. To help our friendly neighbours omsert is creating
an efficient and simple web app with information about the countries of the Earth.

Unfortunately the omsert team is very busy due to several requests from planet KrypIoT
and MarsLearning and therefore needs your help: Develop a fantastic and informative
web app and help us make our friends happy!
